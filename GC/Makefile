# The purpose of this linker script is to place the library at the address
# immediately following the shared memory area, i.e. at
# GC_get_memory()+GC_get_memsize(): with the current #defines, it is at
# 0x31000000000
BASE_ADDRESS=0x31000000000
#
# This is needed because we want to be able to store a pointer to
# e.g. GC_malloc() in the shared memory, and call it from all processes, so
# we need to ensure that the functions are placed at the same virtual
# address.
